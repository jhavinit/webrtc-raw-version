# webrtc-raw-version
This is  a raw version of a webrtc project which can be modified by any communtiy member. It is based on ONSIP and Sip.js
1. This project is a raw version of actual web app that I am working on, this a skeleton for the project.
2. This project uses Sip.js for cross browser compatibility and ONSIP server for signalling.
3. Issues: 1.) how to diaplay online users without using systems like sophia(FREESWITCH).
